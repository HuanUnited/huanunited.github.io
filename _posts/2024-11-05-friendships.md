One of the few things in life that lasts are friendships.

Growing up, I never really learned how to make friends. Because I was quite the troubled child in my past. I would spend long hours on the computer, playing games alone, not really going outside. Back then, the internet was everything for me. And while I did learn some good English because of if, what I got in exchange was an odd personality.

Being brutally honest, and more blunt than a hammer, yet so quirked up in the strangest manners, I was to find out that I was pushing everyone around me away. (TBA)
